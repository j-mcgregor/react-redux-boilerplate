# Pogo 
## Politics made easy

Pogo is an app designed to make political education, participation and activism made free, fun and easy

Content will be a mix of videos, articles, blogs, bite-size chunks and infographics

V1 will be a POC on UK politics with future versions rolling out across EU and European countries, G7 and G20, UN and WTO, US, NATO, Russia, China, South America and Africa

UX/UI is **critical** as the idea is to get as many people engaged as possible
